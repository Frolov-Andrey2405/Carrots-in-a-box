# Carrots-in-a-box
This is a simple and unobtrusive game with bluffing elements for two players. Each player has a box, one of which contains a "carrot" that each player is eager to get. The first player looks into his box and tells the second player whether the "carrot" is there. The second player must then decide whether or not to swap boxes.
